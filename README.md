[Meetup BCN - December 2019](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/C-Programmer-Meetup/events/266779036/)

## Abstract
Package management has been the piece missing in the C++ puzzle from the very beginning, pulling back C++ adoption in many scenarios. The aim of Conan is to fill this gap. In this talk weâ€™ll see how Conan improves the developer experience consuming existing packages, and how developer teams can make their own libraries into Conan making it a suitable tool to handle all the dependencies for a C++ project at any scale.
